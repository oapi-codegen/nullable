# oapi-codegen/nullable

> An implementation of a `Nullable` type for JSON bodies, indicating whether the field is absent, set to null, or set to a value

Unlike other known implementations, this makes it possible to both marshal and unmarshal the value, as well as represent all three states:

- the field is _not set_
- the field is _explicitly set to null_
- the field is _explicitly set to a given value_

And can be embedded in structs, for instance with the following definition:

```go
obj := struct {
		// RequiredID is a required, nullable field
		RequiredID     nullable.Nullable[int]     `json:"id"`
		// RequiredID is an optional, nullable field
		OptionalString *nullable.Nullable[string] `json:"optionalString,omitempty"`
}{}
```

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although this project is under the [oapi-codegen org](https://github.com/oapi-codegen) for the `oapi-codegen` OpenAPI-to-Go code generator, this is intentionally released as a separate, standalone library which can be used by other projects.

First, add to your project with:

```sh
go get github.com/oapi-codegen/nullable
```
